# Overview

This repository contains all of the files that I submitted for the completion of Courses 1-4 in the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization on Coursera. All of the files use the command terminal to input data.

# Course Descriptions:

All of the material covered in each course can be found [here](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-structures-algorithms). However, here are quick overviews of each:

  * **Course 1: Algorithmic Toolbox**
    * _This course covers basic algorithmic techniques and ideas for computational problems arising     frequently in practical applications: sorting and searching, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, dynamic programming._
 
  * **Course 2: Data Structures**
    * _This course covers common data structures that are used in various computational problems. This includes: binary search trees; disjoint sets; dynamic arrays; stacks; non-priority and priority
queues; minimum spanning trees; suffix arrays, trees, and tries._

  * **Course 3: Algorithms on Graphs**
    * _This course covers what a graph is and what are some of the most important properties of a graph. This includes several traversal techniques and useful things to do while traversing the graph._

  * **Course 4: Algorithms on Strings**
    * _Covers several techniques used when dealing with strings in Computer Science: This includes: building suffix tries, trees, and arrays; implimenting the *Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) Algorithm for finding a substring in a string._
